# Pathfinding
Small pathfinding implementation in a grid of Dijkstra and A*. Project made as homework

This project has been created for a short research work that I have been assigned as homework. It may not be optimal but I am glad that I did this little project where I had to research pathfinding from 0.

Feel free to use this as you like.
